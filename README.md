# Winter
Winter is a text-based adventure game (with minimal graphics) wherein the player plays as Winter,
a white Maltese who’s waiting for her owner’s return. Each day is a new adventure with different sets of
challenges. There will be a limited amount of energy, so the player needs to manage when and where
they will use their energy on. The player needs to choose the right choices to gain goodPoints (to get the
good ending), but they also have to keep track of Winter’s health bar. The player will be able to see how
their choice affects Winter by looking at her facial expressions which will be seen all throughout the game.
With the right choices, Winter will be able to escape the house. However, if the player fails to make the
right choices, it will lead to a bad ending.
